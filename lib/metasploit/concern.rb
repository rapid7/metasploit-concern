  # directory in the `Rails::Engine` that declares the concerns.

  # The `Class` or `Module` must support the use of concerns by calling {run}.
  #
  # @example engine_that_supports_concerns/app/models/model_that_supports_concerns.rb
  #   class EngineThatSupportsConcerns::ModelThatSupportsConcerns
  #     # declared as last statement in body so that concerns can redefine everything in class

  # app/concerns.
